# Runway Detection Using YOLOv8 and Active Learning
## Overview
This repository houses the source code and documentation for my Final Year Project (09/2024), which aims to develop an innovative runway detection system using the latest advancements in machine learning. This project employs YOLOv8 for object detection and explores active learning strategies to enhance the training process and improve detection accuracy in various operational scenarios.

## Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project were to:

Implement a neural network using YOLOv8 specifically for the detection of runways from aerial imagery.
Apply active learning strategies to efficiently utilize our data and improve learning outcomes.
Assess the effectiveness of active learning by comparing its performance with traditional random sampling methods, thereby refining our approach to machine learning in this context.
Methodology
YOLOv8 Integration: Utilized YOLOv8 for its state-of-the-art object detection capabilities.
Active Learning Implementation: Developed a systematic approach to select the most informative unlabeled data points for labeling and retraining, thus improving model accuracy iteratively.
Comparative Analysis: Performed extensive comparisons between active learning and random sampling to determine the most effective method for data utilization in training phases.
Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: Enhanced input data quality to maximize the neural network's performance.
